      <h1>POPOF ? - 2024</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        This project is the result of my diploma work. It's a three-month project that we carry out within the school to enrich our portfolios.<br>
As we had carte blanche, I decided to make a 3D animation. It was my first opportunity to produce a short story with a script. I was able to confront the task of telling a story and realize just how complicated the exercise is. <br>
In terms of technique, I mixed traditional 2D animation (Marin), the washing machine is rigged and the robot is animated using a Rokoko motion capture suit. <br>
The three months went by in a flash, but allowed me to go through every steps of production.
